## Robert Henry

Game Designer

Robert Henry is a child of the 80s, and remembers all those great classic games like Monopoly, Stratego, Risk, and Sorry!  (And has great respect for anyone who can extract the rubber band in Operation.)  Nowadays, games truly are something special, with some really innovative stuff continuing to show up on a regular basis.  Participating in game design represents a chance not only to create something new and fun, but to contribute something to this increasingly divided world that can bring people together with joy and laughter in a meaningful way. Joe MainGame Designer
